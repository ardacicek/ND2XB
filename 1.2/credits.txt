ND2XB 1.2 (NAMI DANCE - XBeach Coupling Software) developed by Yagiz Arda Cicek (METU), 2021

Date of Release: 21.10.2021

This  software creates bed.dep, x.grd, y.grd, Boun_U.bcf file and sediment thickness (.dep file) for XBeach Non-hydrostatic module
and writes a params.txt file with updated xfile, yfile, nx, ny and depfile keywords. Files are overwritten; hence, a backup folder 
is created (latestBackup) for the abovementioned files.
